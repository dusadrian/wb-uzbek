    "t2": "INTRODUCTION ",
    "t3": "The primary goal of this data collection is to support the Government of Uzbekistan in transitioning from institutional care to family-type care for children deprived of parental care. To achieve this, we aim to build a robust monitoring mechanism at the national level. By collecting detailed data, we can inform evidence-based decisions and policies that promote family-based alternatives.",
    "t4": "Another critical objective is to enhance the quality of services provided to children with disabilities in institutional care. By understanding their unique needs and experiences, we can develop targeted interventions and improve their overall well-being. Additionally, we seek to explore and promote adequate family-type alternatives for these children.",
    "t5": "The data collection process involves gathering comprehensive information about children placed in institutional care and specialized boarding schools. We explore various aspects, including demographics, family background, health, education, living conditions, and risk behaviors, as well as the availability and effectiveness of recovery and rehabilitation services.",
    "t6": "Please complete this questionnaire separately for each child currently in the child care system, regardless of the type of service they receive (residential or family-based) and whether it's provided by the state or a private provider. This questionnaire will be completed for children in the following types of services of the child care system: children's homes/baby homes, mehribonlik houses, muruvat houses for children with disabilities, family-type children's homes, SOS children's villages/families.",
    "t7": "Complete the information based only on documents and data found in the child's file. If there is no information in the file regarding a specific question, please encircle the \"Unspecified/Unknown\" answer. Please do not include information from sources other than the child's file.",
