To achieve this, we aim to build a robust monitoring mechanism at the national level. By collecting detailed data, we can inform evidence-based decisions and policies that promote family-based alternatives.",
    "t4": "Another critical objective is to enhance the quality of services provided to children with disabilities in institutional care. By understanding their unique needs and experiences, we can develop targeted interventions and improve their overall well-being. Additionally, we seek to explore and promote adequate family-type alternatives for these children. ",
    "t5": "The data collection process involves gathering comprehensive information about children placed in institutional care and specialized boarding schools. We explore various aspects, including demographics, family background, health, education, living conditions, and risk behaviors, as well as the availability and effectiveness of recovery and rehabilitation services.",
