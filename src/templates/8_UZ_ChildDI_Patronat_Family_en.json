    "t2": "INTRODUCTION",
    "t3": "The primary goal of this data collection is to support the Government of Uzbekistan in transitioning from institutional care to family-type care for children deprived of parental care. To achieve this, we aim to build a robust monitoring mechanism at the national level. By collecting detailed data, we can inform evidence-based decisions and policies that promote family-based alternatives.",
    "t4": "Another critical objective is to enhance the quality of services provided to children with disabilities in institutional care. By understanding their unique needs and experiences, we can develop targeted interventions and improve their overall well-being. Additionally, we seek to explore and promote adequate family-type alternatives for these children.",
    "t5": "The purpose of this questionnaire is to gain insights into family-type alternative care. By examining the demographics, experiences, and quality of care provided by foster parents and guardians, we aim to enhance our understanding of this essential approach to child care. Our goal is to inform policies, improve support systems, and ensure the well-being of children in foster families.",
    "t6": "This questionnaire is designed to collect information about patronat families in Uzbekistan, where children who have lost parental care are placed. Please fill out one questionnaire for each patronat family.",
    "t7": "Please base your answers only on the documents and data available in the official file of the patronat family. If the file does not contain information for a specific question, please mark the \"Unspecified/Unknown\" option. Please refrain from using any other sources of information besides the official file.",
