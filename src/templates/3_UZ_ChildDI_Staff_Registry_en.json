    "t4": "The primary goal of this data collection is to support the Government of Uzbekistan in transitioning from institutional care to family-type care for children deprived of parental care. To achieve this, we aim to build a robust monitoring mechanism at the national level. By collecting detailed data, we can inform evidence-based decisions and policies that promote family-based alternatives.",
    "t5": "Another critical objective is to enhance the quality of services provided to children with disabilities in institutional care. By understanding their unique needs and experiences, we can develop targeted interventions and improve their overall well-being. Additionally, we seek to explore and promote adequate family-type alternatives for these children. ",
