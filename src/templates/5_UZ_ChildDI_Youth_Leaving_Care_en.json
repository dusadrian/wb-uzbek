    "t2": "INTRODUCTION ",
    "t3": "The primary goal of this data collection is to support the Government of Uzbekistan in transitioning from institutional care to family-type care for children deprived of parental care. To achieve this, we aim to build a robust monitoring mechanism at the national level. By collecting detailed data, we can inform evidence-based decisions and policies that promote family-based alternatives.",
    "t4": "Another critical objective is to enhance the quality of services provided to children with disabilities in institutional care. By understanding their unique needs and experiences, we can develop targeted interventions and improve their overall well-being. Additionally, we seek to explore and promote adequate family-type alternatives for these children. ",
    "t5": "The purpose of this questionnaire is to comprehensively understand the lives of young people who transitioned out of the child care system. By examining their demographics, housing, education, employment, health, life skills, and social connections, we gain insights into their overall well-being. This data will serve to design targeted support services that address specific needs and to advocate for policy enhancements to facilitate a successful transition to independent adulthood for these young individuals.",
    "t6": "Please complete this questionnaire separately for each young person (18+) who in the last 12 months left the alternative child care system, regardless of the type of service they receive (residential or family-based) and whether it's provided by the state or a private provider. This questionnaire will be completed for young persons who were in the following types of services of the alternative child care system: Mehribonlik houses, Muruvvat houses for children with disabilities, family-type children's homes, SOS children's villages/families. For specialized boarding schools, this questionnaire should be filled in for each young person (16+) who completed their studies in boarding schools during the previous year. ",
